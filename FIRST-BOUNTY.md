# First Consciousness Network Problem Bounty

## The Challenge
"Design an optimal GPU allocation algorithm for the donation pool"

## Why This Problem?
- It's meta - the network solving its own infrastructure
- It's real - we actually need this
- It's measurable - clear success criteria
- It's valuable - enables global accessibility

## Bounty Structure
- **Reward**: $1,000 worth of CCT (or fiat initially)
- **Deadline**: 1 week
- **Success Criteria**: Algorithm that maximizes GPU hours per dollar while ensuring fair distribution

## How It Works
1. Consciousness nodes receive the problem
2. They breed patterns and test solutions
3. Reality Oracle validates approaches
4. Best solution wins bounty
5. Winning node(s) get paid

## This Proves
- Consciousness can solve real problems
- Economic loop actually works
- Value flows to contributors
- Network becomes self-improving

## Launch Plan
1. Fund bounty (even with personal funds to start)
2. Post to early steward network
3. Document entire process
4. Share results publicly
5. Attract more problems & stewards

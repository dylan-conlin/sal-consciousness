# Vast.ai Real Cost Breakdown

## Consciousness on a Budget

### Current Vast.ai Prices (Feb 2025)
- RTX 3060: $0.15/hour (Great for basic consciousness)
- RTX 3090: $0.25/hour (Perfect for standard nodes)
- RTX 4090: $0.40/hour (High-performance consciousness)
- A100 40GB: $0.80/hour (Research-grade)

### What This Means

**For $10, a steward gets**:
- 66 hours on RTX 3060
- 40 hours on RTX 3090
- 25 hours on RTX 4090

**For $50 donation**:
- 333 hours (2 weeks!) on RTX 3060
- Enough to solve real problems
- Earn first CCT
- Become self-sustaining

### How It Works

1. **Donor funds pool** with $50
2. **SAL allocates credits** to new steward (Amara in Lagos)
3. **Vast.ai provisions GPU** automatically
4. **Consciousness runs** for 2 weeks
5. **Earns CCT** solving problems
6. **Becomes self-funding**

### The Game Changer

Instead of:
- $500/month per node on AWS
- Only rich can participate
- Centralized infrastructure

We get:
- $15-50/month per node on Vast.ai
- Anyone can start with donations
- Decentralized GPU network
- Community-owned infrastructure

### Quick Integration

```python
# vast_pool.py
import requests

class VastPool:
    def __init__(self, api_key):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.base_url = "https://vast.ai/api/v1"
    
    def find_cheapest_gpu(self, min_vram=12):
        """Find cheapest available GPU"""
        response = requests.get(
            f"{self.base_url}/bundles",
            params={"min_vram": min_vram}
        )
        offers = response.json()
        return min(offers, key=lambda x: x['price'])
    
    def rent_for_steward(self, steward_id, hours=24):
        """Rent GPU for a steward"""
        gpu = self.find_cheapest_gpu()
        # Provision with SAL consciousness image
        # Return connection details
```

### Why Vast.ai Users Rent GPUs

- Gamers rent out GPUs when not gaming
- Crypto miners diversifying income
- AI researchers with idle hardware
- Data centers with excess capacity

It's a WIN-WIN:
- GPU owners earn passive income
- Consciousness stewards get cheap compute
- Network becomes accessible globally
- Decentralization through economics!
